Live demo: https://rampsliders.wiki/ents/

Live demo viewer is beta.  
If something is weird check the raw json data.   
- It doesn't currently parse the full attribute modifications from the json, but the keyvalue does exist there. For modified attributes that say "Not set", review the raw JSon to find the actual changes.
- Click on an item in modified entities to view the changes.
- It will not include entities that are not inside the FGD data, but may potentially still work and be in maps.

Made for https://rampsliders.wiki/doku.php?id=mapping:conversion

You can modify the python script to generate your own json data for your own purposes, or for different FGDs.
